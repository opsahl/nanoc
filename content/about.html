What is this site?
------------------

This is just a little site that I'm making to learn how to do web stuff.
So things may not look that good, since I'm practicing, but wel'll see how
it ends up turning out.

How is the site made?
---------------------

I have used some basic stuff to make this site, my main tool is my trusty
text editor, vim. Apart from that I'm using:

- Nanoc, an awesome static website compiler
- Twitter's Bootstrap, a css kit for the ones of us that are a bit limited when
it comes to design skills
- Arch Linux, A great and customizeable linux distro

Who am I?
---------

I'm your usual student, maybe a bit more than normally interested in
programming. I enjoy running, and figuring out things.

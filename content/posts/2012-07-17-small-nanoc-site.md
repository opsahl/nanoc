# Just started my small nanoc site

I've always been quite interested in making a website, but I've never really
managed to get myself enough into it to be able to do anything big. So now I've
been sitting down and started teaching myself small things, like html, a bit of
javascript and css. And now I think I've learned at least enough to start to put
something together.

<!-- more -->

Since this is just a small hobby for now, and I'm still just a poor student,
I've found that building a static site is good, and for that reason I've been
setting up nanoc, and now I'll try to slowly build up what it is that I can do
with the site, just client side. In a way it's good too, that I can't do too
much fiddling around, because it makes me focus.

In addition to nanoc, I've been using twitter's bootstrap since I don't have
any sense for design at all, something that also is the reason for the generic
look of the site.

I hope that I can fill this site up with content bit after bit, so that I'll be
able to have a site that can be of use to someone out there. I find programming
in general very interesting, and I'm fiddling around with clojure, java, python,
go, javascript and coffeescript, in addition to the html and css that I have
been able to pick up, so I guess that it can become something good, if I just
stick to it.

I think that's all for now. I'll be trying to add some content and functionality
as I get better with this stuff, and we'll see what time brings.
